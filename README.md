Kotlin File Processor
=====================
A Kotlin program that reads a CSV file, and then for each record, calls a REST API that performs a card payment.

## Running applications
In order to make Java logging work, you need to launch the JVM with the following parameter (example is from Intellij config):
`-Djava.util.logging.config.file=$PROJECT_DIR$/out/production/kotlin-demo/logging.properties`
